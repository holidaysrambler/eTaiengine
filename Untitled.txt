I'll generate both HTTPS and SSH git clone URLs for each repository you listed and show the exact git clone commands to run.

What I did: created the canonical HTTPS and SSH clone URLs for each repo. What's next: run any of the git clone commands below in your terminal to clone the repos.

sshPay
- HTTPS: https://github.com/kptjms991/sshPay.git
- SSH:   git@github.com:kptjms991/sshPay.git
Clone (HTTPS):
```
git clone https://github.com/kptjms991/sshPay.git
```
Clone (SSH):
```
git clone git@github.com:kptjms991/sshPay.git
```

v0-remi-caller-ui
- HTTPS: https://github.com/kptjms991/v0-remi-caller-ui.git
- SSH:   git@github.com:kptjms991/v0-remi-caller-ui.git

```
git clone https://github.com/kptjms991/v0-remi-caller-ui.git
```
Clone (SSH):
```
git clone git@github.com:kptjms991/v0-remi-caller-ui.git
```

template-editor
- HTTPS: https://github.com/kptjms991/template-editor.git

git clone git@github.com:kptjms991/template-editor.git
```

sshPay-new
- HTTPS: https://github.com/kptjms991/sshPay-new.git

git clone git@github.com:kptjms991/sshPay-new.git
```

If you want, I can:
- produce a single shell script that clones all four repos into the current directory, or
- create a README snippet you can paste into a project with these commands. Which would you prefer?
